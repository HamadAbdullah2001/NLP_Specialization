# NLP_Specialization

Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to interpret and manipulate human language.

In the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization, you will learn how to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages, summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications will be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

NLP is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning and is critical in effectively analyzing massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

## Course 1: Natural language processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naïve Bayes,
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.

Week 1: Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

Learn how to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifier for tweets using logistic regression.

Week 2: Sentiment Analysis with Naïve Bayes

Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. You’ll learn how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.

Week 4: Machine Translation and Document Search

Learn how to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality-sensitive hashing to perform machine translation and document search.

## Course 2: Natural language processing with Probabilistic Models

In Course 2 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

a) Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming,
b) Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is vital for computational linguistics,
c) Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and
d) Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.

Week 1: Auto-correct

Learn about autocorrect, minimum edit distance, and dynamic programming, then build your own spellchecker to correct misspelled words.

Week 2: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging and Hidden Markov Models

Learn about Markov chains and Hidden Markov models, then use them to create part-of-speech tags for a Wall Street Journal text corpus.

Week 3: Auto-complete and Language Models

Learn about how N-gram language models work by calculating sequence probabilities, then build your own autocomplete language model using a text corpus from Twitter.

Week 4: Word Embeddings with Neural Networks

Learn how word embeddings carry the semantic meaning of words, making them more powerful for NLP tasks. Then build your own Continuous bag-of-words model to create word embeddings from Shakespeare text.

## Course 3: Natural language processing with Sequence Models

In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

a) Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
b) Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
c) Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and
d) Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.

Week 1: Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis

Learn about neural networks for deep learning, then build a sophisticated tweet classifier that places tweets into positive or negative sentiment categories using a deep neural network.

Week 2: Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling

Learn about the limitations of traditional language models and see how RNNs and GRUs use sequential data for text prediction. Then build your own next-word generator using a simple RNN on Shakespeare text data.

Week 3: LSTMs and Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Learn how long short-term memory units (LSTMs) solve the vanishing gradient problem and how Named Entity Recognition systems quickly extract essential information from text. Then build your own Named Entity Recognition system using an LSTM and data from Kaggle.

Week 4: Siamese Networks

Learn about Siamese networks, a special type of neural network made of two identical networks that are eventually merged, then build your own Siamese network that identifies question duplicates in a dataset from Quora.

## Course 4: Natural language processing with Attention Models

In Course 4 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

a) Translate complete English sentences into German using an encoder-decoder attention model,
b) Build a Transformer model to summarize text,
c) Use T5 and BERT models to perform question-answering, and
d) Build a chatbot using a Reformer model.

Week 1: Neural Machine Translation with Attention models

Discover some of the shortcomings of a traditional seq2seq model and how to solve for them by adding an attention mechanism, then build a Neural Machine Translation model with Attention that translates English sentences into German.

Week 2: Text Summarization with Transformer models

Compare RNNs and other sequential models to the more modern Transformer architecture, then create a tool that generates text summaries.

Week 3: Question-Answering

Explore transfer learning with state-of-the-art models like T5 and BERT, then build a model that can answer questions.

Week 4: Chatbots with Reformer models

Examine some unique challenges Transformer models face and their solutions, then build a chatbot using a Reformer model.
